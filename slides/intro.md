Abstract (up to 200 words) *
Software licensing is a complex topic and an important part of the Intellectual Property framework we all find ourselves in. So what is so special about software that it needs its own licensing? Why would I want a licence for software I work on? and What licence is right for our project?

In this discussion group we'll explain the fundamentals of software licensing and why it exists. We'll cover the major families of open source licences like the GPL, MIT and Creative Commons. We will also explain the characteristics of the major families of software licensing and discuss trends in software licensing. We will take any questions or comments about open source software and licensing. If we have time we'll cover a few practical examples of what a software licence enables developers and users to do with a pice of work.
